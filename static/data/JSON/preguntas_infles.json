The ability to communicate effectively using digital tools is a key skill for success. One of the most important aspects of technological communication is the use of multimedia, which combines text, video, and audio to convey messages more effectively. Cloud computing is another essential element, enabling users to store and access information from anywhere, at any time. As we become more reliant on digital tools, having strong digital literacy is essential to navigate the complex digital world.\nRetroalimentación\nLa respuesta correcta es:\nWhat does \"cloud computing\" allow users to do? → It allows users to store and access information from anywhere.,\nAccording to the text, why is technological communication important? → It plays a crucial role in both personal and professional environments.,\nWhat are two key elements of technological communication mentioned in the text? → Multimedia and cloud computing.,\nWhat combines text, video, and audio to convey messages more effectively? → multimedia\nCorrecta\nPuntos para este envío: 2,00/2,00.\nPregunta 4\nFinalizado\nSe puntúa 2,00 sobre 2,00\nMarcar pregunta\nEnunciado de la pregunta\nPart 4: Short Answer (2 points)\nWrite a short paragraph (100-120 words) explaining how technological communication has changed the way we interact with others. Include examples of tools or platforms you use regularly.\nTexto de la respuesta Pregunta 4\nTechnological communication has drastically transformed how we interact,bridging geographical gaps and enabling instant connectivity. In the past, professional and personal exchanges were sloweb and location-dependent.\nToday, tools like WhatsApp allow for inmediate personal updates, while platforms such as Microsoft Teams or Zoom have revolutionized professional collaboration, making remote work viable. As an engineering student, I also use Discord and GitHub to coordinate projects and share code in real time.\nAlthough this shift has reduced face-to-face contact, it has undeniably increased efficiency and global accessibility, allowing us to maintain relationships and work flows regardless of physical distance.\nConsequently, mastering these digital channelsl is now a fundamental requirement for any successful engineer.\nCLE 2 Feedback U2Final del formulario\nPregunta 1\nCorrecta\nSe puntúa 1,00 sobre 1,00\nMarcar pregunta\nEnunciado de la pregunta\nMemories shape who we are. Reflecting on past experiences often evokes emotions—sometimes nostalgia, other times regret or even joy. Many people find themselves reminiscing about their childhood, recalling carefree days spent playing outside, exploring the world with a sense of wonder that can be difficult to recapture as adults. The smell of a particular dish might remind someone of family gatherings, while an old song may transport them back to a school dance or a summer holiday.\nMemories have the power to influence our decisions. People often compare current situations to past experiences, using what they learned from previous successes or failures to guide their actions. A person who once failed at a job interview may remember the mistakes they made and use that experience to prepare better for the next opportunity. Similarly, a joyful memory, like winning a sports match, can motivate someone to pursue their goals, believing that such moments of success are possible again.\nHowever, memories are not always reliable. Our brains do not record everything perfectly, and often we unconsciously alter details.
